# UWU üëâüèΩüëàüèΩ

This language main intent is to be familiar to the developers who use it. Almost like it is ***simping*** for the developer.

Language design is still a work in progress please update as you see fit.

var cost = 12.44;
var cost:decimal = 12.44;
```

x = 12;
cost = 12.44;
```

**Function Definition**

	}
	...
